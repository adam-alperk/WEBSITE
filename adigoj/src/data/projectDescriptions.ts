  Carnival: `I composed this music for a game jam submission for Narrative Driven Jam #12. The music was to be played in a light hearted carnival scene. This piece is a light, orchestral waltz in 6/4. It opens with a soft, playful mood driven by strings, mallets, woodwinds, and piano. The transition section leads into a slightly mischievous theme, still gentle but with a hint of attitude. After that, the opening idea returns, this time with a bit more weight as French Horns join in to round out the sound.`,
  Bittersweet: `Me and my friend Ollie(Indiana Sage) wrote, composed and recorded this song in just 90 minutes in a jam session. The theme was a musician's view of the bittersweet world and trying to write a song for it.`,
