- Our final term project at Vancouver Film School centered on interactive sound design and implementation. As a team of three, we created and integrated sound assets into a video game developed by fellow students. Our responsibilities included mixing, ambient effects, and troubleshooting, with regular milestones prompting presentations of our progress and challenges. This project mirrored the demands of AAA gaming companies, emphasizing precision and problem-solving.
